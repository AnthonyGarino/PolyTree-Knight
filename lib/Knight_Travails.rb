# 1. Write a class, KnightPathFinder. Initialize your KnightPathFinder with a starting position. For instance:
# 2. Goal of project is kpf.find_path([2, 1]) # => [[0, 0], [2, 1]]kpf.find_path([3, 3]) # => [[0, 0], [2, 1], [3, 3]] to find paths to end positions
# 3. To help us find paths, we will build a move tree. The values  the tree will be positions. A node is a child of another node if you can move from the parent position directly to the child position. The root node of the tree should be the knights starting position
# 4. You will want to build on your PolyTreeNode work, using PolyTreeNode instances to represent each position.
# 5. Start by creating an instance variable, self.root_node that stores the knight, initial position in an instance of your PolyTreeNode class.
# 6. You will be writing an instance method KnightPathFinder#build_move_tree to build the move tree, beginning with self.root_node. Call this method in initialize; You will traverse the move tree whenever #find_path is called. Don't write this yet though.
# 7 Build new positions, find all posible moves from a given position.  Write a class method KnightPathFinder::valid_moves(pos). There are up to eight possible moves
# 8.You'll also want to avoid repeating positions in the move tree. For instance, we don't want to infinitely explore moving betweeen the same two positions. Add an instance variable, @considered_positions to keep track of the positions you have considered; initialize it to the array containing just the starting pos. Write an instance method #new_move_positions(pos); this should call the ::valid_moves class method, but filter out any positions that are already in @considered_positions. It should then add the remaining new positions to @considered_positions and return these new positions.

# Phase II: #build_move_tree
# Let's return to #build_move_tree. We'll use our #new_move_positions instance method.

# To ensure that your tree represents only the shortest path to a given position, build your tree in a breadth-first manner. Take inspiration from your BFS algorithm: use a queue to process nodes in FIFO order. Start with a root node representing the start_pos and explore moves from one position at a time.

# Next build nodes representing positions one move away, add these to the queue. Then take the next node from the queue... until the queue is empty.

# When you have completed, and tested, #build_move_tree get a code review from your TA.

# Head to Part 2!
# Once you are finished with phases 1 & 2 head over to Part Two. Accessing this on GitHub? Use this link.
